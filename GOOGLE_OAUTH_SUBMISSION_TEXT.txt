REQUESTED SCOPES AND JUSTIFICATIONS:

1. openid
HOW IT WILL BE USED:
Required for OAuth 2.0 authentication protocol. This scope enables secure user authentication through Google Sign-In, allowing users to log into Rapid Launch Agent without creating a separate password. This is the foundation of our Single Sign-On (SSO) implementation.

2. https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email
HOW IT WILL BE USED:
Used to retrieve the user's primary Google account email address for the following purposes:
- Create and uniquely identify user accounts in our system
- Send project notifications, AI generation updates, and system alerts
- Provide customer support and respond to user inquiries
- Enable account recovery processes
- Facilitate team collaboration features
The email address is stored securely in our database and is never shared with third parties for advertising purposes as stated in our Privacy Policy.

3. https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile
HOW IT WILL BE USED:
Used to retrieve the user's basic profile information including their full name and profile picture URL. This information is used to:
- Personalize the user interface by displaying the user's name in the application header
- Show the user's profile picture for easy account identification
- Populate user settings and account management sections
- Display collaborator information when multiple users work on shared projects
This creates a more intuitive and personalized user experience while maintaining account security.
