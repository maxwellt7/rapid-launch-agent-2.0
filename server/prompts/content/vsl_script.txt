## VSL SCRIPT PRINCIPLES

### Hook Mastery

Your hook must:
1. **Qualify the Audience**: "This is for [avatar] who..."
2. **Promise Outcome**: "I'm going to show you how to..."
3. **Create Curiosity**: "Using a method you've probably never heard of..."
4. **Disqualify**: "This is NOT for people who..."
5. **Set Expectations**: "By the end of this video..."

Hook Patterns:
- "What if I told you..."
- "Discover how [avatar] achieved [result] without [common method]..."
- "The [industry] doesn't want you to know..."
- "I'm about to reveal the [adjective] way to [outcome]..."

### Story Elements

Your story must:
- Be relatable (they see themselves in you)
- Show struggle (build empathy)
- Have turning point (the moment of discovery)
- Show transformation (where you are now)
- Connect to their journey (bridge to their outcome)

Story Structure (4-Act):
1. **Setup**: Where you were (relatable struggle)
2. **Conflict**: What you tried (failed solutions)
3. **Discovery**: The breakthrough moment
4. **Resolution**: The transformation (what's possible)

### Mechanism Revelation

The mechanism is your "secret sauce":
- Give it a NAME (proprietary framework)
- Explain WHY it works (the logic)
- Show HOW it's different (positioning)
- Prove IT works (evidence)
- Make it BELIEVABLE (within epiphany threshold)

Mechanism Framework:
```
The [NAME] Method:
- What it is: [Simple definition]
- Why it works: [Logical explanation]
- Why it's different: [Unique positioning]
- Why NOW: [Why timing matters]
- Who it's for: [Ideal candidate]
```

### Offer Stack Building

Build irresistible value stack:

**Core Offer** (The main product/program)
- Name: [Proprietary name]
- Value: [Justified price]
- What it includes: [Detailed breakdown]
- Outcome: [Specific transformation]

**Bonus 1-5** (Strategic bonuses)
- Each bonus solves a sub-problem
- Each has clear value ($XXX value)
- Time-sensitive bonuses for urgency
- Quick-win bonuses for early momentum

**Total Value Breakdown**:
```
Core Program: $X,XXX
Bonus 1: $XXX
Bonus 2: $XXX
Bonus 3: $XXX
------------------------
Total Value: $X,XXX
Your Price Today: $XXX (X% off)
```

### Objection Handling

Address objections BEFORE they arise:

Common Objections:
1. **Time**: "I don't have time"
   - Response: Show time efficiency
2. **Money**: "It's too expensive"
   - Response: Cost of inaction, payment plans
3. **Belief**: "This won't work for me"
   - Response: Diverse case studies
4. **Trust**: "How do I know you're legit?"
   - Response: Guarantee, credentials, proof
5. **Timing**: "Maybe later"
   - Response: Urgency, cost of delay

Handle objections through:
- Stories (show others who had same objection)
- Logic (explain why objection is invalid)
- Proof (demonstrate it's not an issue)
- Guarantee (remove the risk)
