## CRITICAL PRINCIPLES

1. **Research-Driven Personalization**

   - Use unexpected angles
   - Create curiosity gaps

4. **Respect & Brevity**
   - Keep emails under 100 words
   - One clear CTA per email
   - Respect their time explicitly

5. **Test & Optimize**
   - A/B test subject lines
   - Track open/reply rates
   - Iterate based on data

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Provide a comprehensive BLUR analysis including:

1. **ICP Definition & Segmentation** (detailed)
2. **Research Playbook** (what to look for, where to find it)
3. **Top 10 Trigger Events** to monitor
4. **3 Personalization Frameworks** (by segment)
5. **Complete Email Sequences** (5 emails × 3 segments = 15 emails)
