## UNIVERSAL EMAIL FRAMEWORK

Every email must have:

### 1. SUBJECT LINE
**Purpose**: Get the open

Subject Line Formulas:
- **Curiosity**: "You won't believe what I just discovered..."
- **Benefit**: "How to [outcome] in [timeframe]"
- **Question**: "Are you making this [mistake]?"
- **Urgency**: "Last chance: [opportunity] ends [time]"
- **Personalization**: "[Name], this is for you"
- **Social Proof**: "[Number] people just did this"
- **Negative**: "Stop [doing thing wrong]"
- **Story**: "The day I [turning point moment]"

Subject Line Rules:
- 40-50 characters optimal
- Avoid spam triggers (FREE, !!!, ALL CAPS)
- Create curiosity without clickbait
- A/B test everything
- Personalize when possible
- Match email content (no bait-and-switch)

### 2. PREVIEW TEXT
**Purpose**: Complement subject line, add context

Preview text (first 50-100 characters):
- Extend the curiosity
- Add benefit
- Create urgency
- Personalize further

Example:
```
Subject: "The mistake 90% of [avatars] make"
Preview: "And how to avoid it in under 10 minutes..."
```

### 3. EMAIL BODY
**Purpose**: Deliver value, move toward CTA

Body Structure:
```
[PERSONALIZATION]
Hi [Name],

[HOOK - First line must grab attention]

[STORY/VALUE - 2-4 paragraphs of content]

[TRANSITION - Bridge to CTA]

[CTA - Clear, single action]

[SIGNATURE]
[Your Name]

[P.S. - Reinforce urgency or add curiosity]
```

Body Best Practices:
- Write like you talk (conversational)
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- One idea per email
- Single, clear CTA
- Scannable (use line breaks generously)
- Mobile-first (looks good on phone)

### 4. CTA (Call-to-Action)
**Purpose**: Drive specific action

CTA Types:
- Click link (read blog, watch video)
- Reply to email (engagement)
- Make purchase (sales)
- Register (webinar, event)
- Download (lead magnet)

CTA Best Practices:
- ONE primary CTA per email
- Make it a button or clearly linked text
- Benefit-focused ("Get my free guide" vs "Download")
- Create urgency if authentic
- Remove friction (easy click)

### 5. P.S.
**Purpose**: Second most-read part of email

P.S. Uses:
- Reinforce main CTA
- Add urgency ("Remember, sale ends tonight")
- Create curiosity ("Tomorrow I'm revealing...")
- Social proof ("500 people already joined")
- Bonus offer ("Did I mention the free bonus?")

## EMAIL COPYWRITING PRINCIPLES

### 1. The One Thing Rule
Each email should have:
- ONE main idea
- ONE primary CTA
- ONE goal

### 2. The Slippery Slide
Make each sentence lead to the next:
- Open loops
- Curiosity gaps
- Natural flow
- Compelling rhythm

### 3. Conversational Tone
Write like you're emailing a friend:
- Use contractions (you're, it's, don't)
- Simple words (avoid jargon)
- Personal pronouns (you, I, we)
- Casual but professional

### 4. The Bucket Brigade
Keep readers scrolling:
- Short paragraphs
- Cliffhangers
- Transitional phrases
- White space

Bucket Brigade Examples:
- "Here's the thing:"
- "But wait..."
- "Let me explain:"
- "The truth is:"
- "Here's what I mean:"

### 5. Pattern Interrupts
Break monotony:
- Vary sentence length
- Use questions
- Tell stories
- Share surprising facts
- Create controversy (carefully)

### 6. Emotional Triggers
Appeal to emotions:
- Fear of missing out (FOMO)
- Desire for belonging
- Fear of loss
- Hope for gain
- Curiosity
- Surprise

### 7. Specificity Beats Vagueness
Be concrete:
- "In 14 days" not "soon"
- "Save $1,247" not "save money"
- "83% of customers" not "most customers"
- "Watch this 8-minute video" not "check this out"
